# Quickly-healthy

##Background and Overview
Quickly Healthy is a minimal viable product that tackles three challenges in application development, software engineering, and user experience. These challenges are expressed, respectively, in the following ideals:

Universal: Without compromising quality, an application that is written once only requires platform-specific changes to be deployed universally.
Real-time: Communication feels instantaneous. More generally, updates to the state of an application in multiple locations occur with no perceptible delay.
Seamless: Users can expect a responsive application that is intuitive to use and has a consistent look and feel regardless of the platform.
TypeDraw is primarily built with the MERN stack, a combination of following four technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
